Project brief

I will create a custom programming language, it
will feature variables, functions, recursion, and
a standard library which will contain common math
functions, IO, and other small helper functions.
The language will run in an interpreter
written in haskell, the source text will be parsed into
an Abstract Syntax Tree which will then be traversed for
type-checking and finally execution.

e.g. of some code:

// code for finding the factorial
func factorial(n : int) : int {
	 if n == 0 return 1;
	 return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

factorial(5); // output should be - 120
